>A Letter to a Stranger. üíå 

### Dear Stranger, <br>
Is this your first time learning about creative computing? For me, my week in creative computing has been a total different experience 
compared to the previous weeks...playing with technology, circults and unbelieveably writing a lot of text! 
<br>.<br>
I initially was overwhelmed just by the term 'creative computing.' <br>
I didn't know what it means and what we would be doing. <br>
.<br>
Anxious, <br>
0 experience > out of my confort zone. <br>
Excited, <br>
a growing industry > new possibility > why not? <br>
.<br>
Now, it's your turn to try out the brief for creative computing. 
Don't stress! I was just like you, figuring out arduino, tinkercad, and github platform. My advice for you is to have an open mind to play with all possibilities, and you will do just fine.
Hopefully you will enjoy your week, just like I did. <br>
<br> <br>
From, <br>
A friend.

In class, I learned how to to build a circult by watching the tutorial link that was on the moodle page. The attempt was unsuccessful, although we followed the step-to-step guide, the light only flikers once connected. We didn't want to give up that easily and tried looking at the other tutorials to figure out what was wrong with our circult, however, we can't seem to resolve the problem, thus, We accepted that it didn't work and moved on.  Sometimes technology fail and it is common! Don't doubt or be too harsh on yourself! It happens sometimes!

<h2 align="center"> Playing with Arduino ‚ù§ </h2>

After the unsuccessful trial, I decided to use my knowledge of building the circult and applying onto Arduino. Out of the projects listed, I was interested in Project 3: Love-o-Meter. I followed the step to step guide on the project guide to set up a "love-o-meter". It measures the body temperature and lights up a string of LEDs to show you how "hot" you are. I find this so cool and enjoyed myself while following the step to step guide to create this circult!

(A gif to commemorate scratch. It was so popular for a period of time, and I spend a lot of time using the program to create projects.) 

During this week I played with Arduino, which is a prototyping platform that allows me to create interactive electronic objects. This made me remember the times when I used Scratch to create projects using simple coding language. Thus, I thought it might be sweet to create a simple gif with 3 moving images to commemorate the program that I loved dearly.

<h2 align="center"> Reflection </h2>
I enjoyed my creative computing week. Although I have played with circults before in GCSE Physics, it was a while back, thus most of the things I forgot. It was diffcult at first playing with the circults in class, our group didn't figure out how to make the circult work which was stressful. But later on, using Arduino, I tried out some of the lessons and did one of the project "Love-o-meter" which was simple by following the step-to-step guide. I would like to continue playing with Arduino if possible in the future to try out more possibilities with the circult and incorporate this learning to my future projects. I had a go creating gifs and using simple markdown to create this README file. I just have to tell myself to ...

is an experimental mask that explores the relationship between our online personas and offline self. It responds to one's real time online emotions. It is heavily inspired by the Chinese face changing opera art ÂèòËÑ∏ (bi√†n li«én) and online avatars. ÂèòËÑ∏ translates to face changing. The performer changes their face to signify a shift in emotion. This performance parallels our online behaviours; we wear many faces online and are able to change them at any moment.
