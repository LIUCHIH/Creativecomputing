>A Letter to a Stranger. üíå 

### Dear Stranger, <br>
Is this your first time learning about creative computing? For me, my week in creative computing has been a total different experience 
compared to the previous weeks...playing with technology, circults and unbelieveably writing a lot of text! 
<br>.<br>
I initially was overwhelmed just by the term 'creative computing.' <br>
I didn't know what it means and what we would be doing. <br>
.<br>
Anxious, <br>
0 experience > out of my confort zone. <br>
Excited, <br>
a growing industry > new possibility > why not? <br>
.<br>
Now, it's your turn to try out the brief for creative computing. 
Don't stress! I was just like you, figuring out arduino, tinkercad, and github platform. My advice for you is to have an open mind to play with all possibilities, and you will do just fine.
Hopefully you will enjoy your week, just like I did. <br>
<br> <br>
From, <br>
A friend.
<br><br><br>

In class, I learned how to to build a circult by watching the tutorial link that was on the moodle page. The attempt was unsuccessful, although we followed the step-to-step guide, the light only flikers once connected. We didn't want to give up that easily and tried looking at the other tutorials to figure out what was wrong with our circult, however, we can't seem to resolve the problem, thus, We accepted that it didn't work and moved on.  Sometimes technology fail and it is common! Don't doubt or be too harsh on yourself! It happens sometimes!

After the unsuccessful trial, I decided to use my knowledge of building the circult and applying onto Arduino. Out of the projects listed, I was interested in Project 3: Love-o-Meter. I followed the step to step guide on the project guide to set up a "love-o-meter". It measures the body temperature and lights up a string of LEDs to show you how "hot" you are. I find this so cool and enjoyed myself while following the step to step guide to create this circult!

<h2 align="center"> Reflection </h2>
I initially thought this week we would be learning about coding, and was overwhelmed just by the term 'creative computing.' I didn't know exactly what we were going to do which made me anxious and excited at the same time. Anxious, because I have yet learned anything about it so it is out of my confort zone to touch this field, yet....excited, because I know it is a growing industry that continues to develop so I have always wanted to try it and learn more about it. I approached the brief with an open mind, I started by experimenting with Arduino by doing some of the task, and later on with Tinkercad. I didn't have a set objective at the start of the week, and was not too stressed to create a set outcome which made the week enjoyable while discovering more creative computing while learning and doing. It has shown me a new pathway of creating which could be used in future projects, and I would like to continue to discover and play.
