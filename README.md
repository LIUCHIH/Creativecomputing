# A Letter to a Stranger. ðŸ’Œ 

### Dear Stranger, <br>
Is this your first time learning about creative computing? For me, my week in creative computing has been a total different experience 
compared to the previous weeks...playing with technology, circults and unbelieveably writing a lot of text! 
<br>.<br>
I initially was overwhelmed just by the term 'creative computing.' <br>
I didn't know what it means and what we would be doing. <br>
.<br>
Anxious, <br>
0 experience > out of my confort zone. <br>
Excited, <br>
a growing industry > new possibility > why not? <br>
.<br>
Now, it's your turn to try out the brief for creative computing. 
Don't stress! I was just like you, figuring out arduino, tinkercad, and github platform. My advice for you is to have an open mind to play with all possibilities, and you will do just fine.
Hopefully you will enjoy your week, just like I did. I have attached a guide with this letter, hopefully it will support you in some way. <br>
<br> <br>
From, <br>
Helena 

# A Guide. ðŸ“•
Hello, I am a user-friendly guide for those who are first-time learners 
### Hello!
p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. Howe

â€™m new to arduino and tinkercad. <strong> Perhaps you are just the same as ME! </strong> <br>
It is my first time learning about creative computing, and I will use this READ.ME file platform to also help/encourage those who are first-time learners of creative computing, who are also trying to figure out their way around.) <br>

## Introduction: Definitions
<h5> Here are some of the definitions that are useful in starting off this project. </h5>
<p> Creative computing: Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines. People use computers as aids to creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. This involves coding, building apps, craft digital experiences, explore machine intelligence and more which are valued by today's businesses with <strong> higher demand!</strong> </h5>
<p> Physical computing: Physical computing means interacting with real-world objects by programming them from a computer. Examples includes automatic doors and voice recognition. For this project, Arduino is the platform we use which is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
<p> Open source: Open sourse is a computer software that is released for use by anyone, for any purpose. 
<p> ReadME file: The Readme file is often the first file which the users read. It is a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code,game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates. 
<p> STEAM: STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, arts and maths - acknowledging that the arts are a huge part of the scientific industry.<br>
<p> Tinkercad is a free-of-charge, online 3D modeling program that runs in a web browser. Since it became available in 2011 it has become a popular platform for creating models for 3D printing as well as an entry-level introduction to constructive solid geometry in schools 
<p> Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices.

 Guide for first time learners trying to upload video onto Github.

###### How to upload images onto Github?
1. Send the image from your phone to your computer.<br>
2. Go on the raw file on Github <br>
3. Select the file image and drag it directly to the raw file on Github <br>
4. See if it works properly by pressing the preview button (next to the 'edit file' button) <br>
<strong> SUCCESS! </strong>
 
###### How to upload videos onto Github?
1. For videos you need to make it a mp4 file.<br>  
2. Drag the file onto the raw file on Github <br>
3. For me, when I dragged the mp4 file directly from my mac to this raw space and when I pressed preview the video was very <strong> brIGHT </strong> <br>
4. If this is the case for you2, then compress the file and then drag onto the raw space. 
5. See if it works properly by pressing the preview button (next to the 'edit file' button) <br>
<strong> SUCCESS! </strong>
<br>

Hope this helps,
Helena
