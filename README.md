# A Letter to a Stranger. ðŸ’Œ 

### Dear Stranger, <br>
Is this your first time learning about creative computing? For me, my week in creative computing has been a total different experience 
compared to the previous weeks...playing with technology, circults and unbelieveably writing a lot of text! 
<br>.<br>
I initially was overwhelmed just by the term 'creative computing.' <br>
I didn't know what it means and what we would be doing. <br>
.<br>
Anxious, <br>
0 experience > out of my confort zone. <br>
Excited, <br>
a growing industry > new possibility > why not? <br>
.<br>
Now, it's your turn to try out the brief for creative computing. 
Don't stress! I was just like you, figuring out arduino, tinkercad, and github platform. My advice for you is to have an open mind to play with all possibilities, and you will do just fine.
Hopefully you will enjoy your week, just like I did. I have attached a guide with this letter, hopefully it will support you in some way. <br>
<br> <br>
From, <br>
A friend.

# A Guide to Github, ReadMe. ðŸ“•

## Introduction: Definitions
<h5> Here are some of the definitions that are useful in starting off this project. </h5>
<p> Creative computing: Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines. People use computers as aids to creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. This involves coding, building apps, craft digital experiences, explore machine intelligence and more which are valued by today's businesses with higher demand! <br>
<p> Open source: Open sourse is a computer software that is released for use by anyone, for any purpose. 
<p> ReadME file: The Readme file is often the first file which the users read. It is a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code,game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates. <br>

### Hello! <br>
I am an user-friendly guide for those who are struggling to write a good README file on Github. It'll help you learn how to get started writing helpful and clear documentations and make it accessible to everyone. 
<br>

### First, Why Do I need a Good README File? <br> 

A README file is a guide that gives users a detailed description of a project that you have pushed to your repository.

Perhaps you are wondering why you should spend time writing a good README. Well are some reasons to help convince you that it's a good idea:

A good README helps your projects stand out from a bunch of other projects. It should be as good as the project itself.
It is the first file a person will see when they encounter your project, so it should be fairly brief but detailed.
It will help you focus on what your project needs to deliver and how.
 

### So let's get started <br>
Guide for first time learners trying to upload video onto Github.
###### How to upload images onto Github?
1. Send the image from your phone to your computer.<br>
2. Go on the raw file on Github <br>
3. Select the file image and drag it directly to the raw file on Github <br>
4. See if it works properly by pressing the preview button (next to the 'edit file' button) <br>
<strong> SUCCESS! </strong>
 
###### How to upload videos onto Github?
1. For videos you need to make it a mp4 file.<br>  
2. Drag the file onto the raw file on Github <br>
3. For me, when I dragged the mp4 file directly from my mac to this raw space and when I pressed preview the video was very <strong> brIGHT </strong> <br>
4. If this is the case for you2, then compress the file and then drag onto the raw space. 
5. See if it works properly by pressing the preview button (next to the 'edit file' button) <br>
<strong> SUCCESS! </strong>
<br>

Hope this helps,
A friend.
