>A Letter to a Stranger. ðŸ’Œ 

### Dear Stranger, <br>
Is this your first time learning about creative computing? For me, my week in creative computing has been a total different experience 
compared to the previous weeks...playing with technology, circults and unbelieveably writing a lot of text! 
<br>.<br>
I initially was overwhelmed just by the term 'creative computing.' <br>
I didn't know what it means and what we would be doing. <br>
.<br>
Anxious, <br>
0 experience > out of my confort zone. <br>
Excited, <br>
a growing industry > new possibility > why not? <br>
.<br>
Now, it's your turn to try out the brief for creative computing. 
Don't stress! I was just like you, figuring out arduino, tinkercad, and github platform. My advice for you is to have an open mind to play with all possibilities, and you will do just fine.
Hopefully you will enjoy your week, just like I did. I have attached a guide with this letter, hopefully it will support you in some way. <br>
<br> <br>
From, <br>
A friend.

3. How to format.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Hello! <br>
I am an user-friendly guide for those who are struggling to create an interesting README file on Github. README file is basically a documental file that allows you to write long text, which is boring to read! Here are some tips that can make your README file stand out from the crowd! 
<br>

### First, Why Do I need a Good README File? <br> 

> Open source community is growing rapidly. Developers release new open-source projects on GitHub every day. As a result, itâ€™s becoming more and more difficult to get your own project to stand out from the sea of open-source software. <br> 
<p> 
> A README is like the face of your project. <br>

It should: 
1. Make your project stand out from others
2. Brief but detailed
3. Focus on what your project needss to deliever and how 
 
### So let's get started <br>
> For first time learners trying to make their README file interesting~! 
#### 1. How to upload images onto Github?
1. Send the image from your phone to your computer.<br>
2. Go on the raw file on Github <br>
3. Select the file image and drag it directly to the raw file on Github <br>
4. See if it works properly by pressing the preview button (next to the 'edit file' button) <br>
<strong> SUCCESS! </strong>
 
#### 2. How to upload videos onto Github?
1. For videos you need to make it a mp4 file.<br>  
2. Drag the file onto the raw file on Github <br>
3. For me, when I dragged the mp4 file directly from my mac to this raw space and when I pressed preview the video was very <strong> brIGHT </strong> <br>
4. If this is the case for you2, then compress the file and then drag onto the raw space. 
5. See if it works properly by pressing the preview button (next to the 'edit file' button) <br>
<strong> SUCCESS! </strong>

#### 3. How to format?
Formatting is an essential part of README. You can learn about how to format your README from https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

#### 4. Try all possibilties! Don't limit yourself on this platform! 
<br><br>
Hope this helps,<br>
